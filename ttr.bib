               specific visual agnosia to specify the nature of his 
               functional impairment. In Exp 1, the S performed a task of 
               picture/word matching that used line drawings of fruits and 
               vegetables as stimuli. The pattern of confusions exhibited by 
               the S suggested a failure in processing the full range of 
               shape features necessary for the unique specification of the 
               target relative to other structurally related items. This 
               hypothesis of a shape integration impairment was tested by 
               visual recognition experiments (Exps 2-4), that used 
               synthetic stimuli with shapes precisely defined on the 
               dimensions of elongation, curvature, and tapering. It was 
               determined (Exp 5) that the integration deficit is specific 
               to the retrieval of shape knowledge from memory and does not 
               affect the encoding of the properties of visual stimuli. 
               Findings have critical implications for cognitive theories of 
               visual object recognition and for an interpretation of the 
               visual function of the inferior temporal cortex. The S's 
               deficit for structural knowledge integration was modulated by 
               the semantic properties of the objects (Exp 6), demonstrating 
               an explanation of category-specific visual agnosia. ((c) 1997

               of concrete single words. Eight showed significant impairment 
               on word-to-picture matching, when distractors were 
               semantically and not just perceptually confusable. These 8 
               also made errors in answering verbal probe questions 
               concerning the same items. When tested on a nonverbal 
               pictorial version of the same probe questions, 3 of these 8 
               improved their performance to the level of normal controls. 
               The other 5 showed continuing impairment in indicating 
               responses to pictorial probes. These 5 showed no evidence of 
               generalized intellectual impairment, and it is concluded that 
               they demonstrated a comprehension deficit not limited to the 
               verbal domain. Unlike the other aphasic Ss, these latter 5 
               also had CT scan lesions extending into the posterior left 
               temporal lobe. They were also more impaired in terms of 
               general aphasia severity. It is suggested that a nonverbal 
               (as well as verbal) semantic memory deficit occurs in a 
               subgroup of patients with single word comprehension 
               disturbance due to aphasia, and this may reflect general 
               severity of language impairment as well as damage to certain 
               localized brain regions. ((c) 1997 APA/PsycINFO, all rights

               not be identified when members of a set varied along a single 
               but not along multiple shape dimensions. Exps 2-6 showed that 
               for both the patient and, to a much lesser degree, healthy 
               Ss, this dimensionality effect was modulated by semantics. By 
               pairing the exact same shapes with semantically close vs

               impact on the patient's identification performance. For

               objects are more likely than nonbiological objects to have 
               the combination of semantic proximity and shared values along 
               multiple shape dimensions that pose recognition problems for 
               patients with such specificity deficits. ((c) 1998

               or disparate labels, and Ss (8 65-85 yr old DAT patients and

		  Three studies explored whether and when children
		  could categorize objects o n the basis of a novel
		  underlying causal power. To test this we constructed
		  a blicket detector, a machine that lit up and
		  played music when certain objects we re placed on
		  it. First, 2-, 3- and 4-yr-old children saw that an
		  object labeled as a blicket would set off the
		  machine. In a categorization task, other object s
		  were demonstrated on the machine. Some set it off
		  and some did not. Children w ere asked to say which
		  objects were blickets. In an induction task, other
		  object s were or were not labeled as
		  blickets. Children had to predict which objects wo
		  uld have the causal power to set off the
		  machine. The causal power could conflic t with
		  perceptual properties of the object, such as color
		  and shape. In an assoc iation task the object was
		  associated with the machine's lighting up but did
		  not cause it to light up. Even the youngest children
		  sometimes used the causal powe r to determine the
		  object's name rather than using its perceptual
		  properties and sometimes used the object's name
		  rather than its perceptual properties to predi ct
		  the object's causal powers. Children rarely
		  categorized the object on the bas is of the
		  associated event. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2000

		  stages of object identification combine in an
		  interactive rather than an additive manner,
		  consistent with object processing stages operating

		  manner. Neuropsychological evidence supports this
		  proposal, demonstrating that subtle perceptual
		  deficits can produce naming problems, even when
		  there is good access to associated semantic
		  knowledge. Functional activation studies further
		  show increased activity in visual processing areas
		  when conditions stress object naming relative to the
		  recognition of familiar object structures. These
		  studies indicate that object naming is based on a
		  series of continuous processing stages and that

               52 yr olds. Stimuli were outline drawings and the tasks were 
               naming and word-picture matching. For man-made objects, the 
               only category specific effect was in the left posterior 
               middle temporal cortex, which was most active for drawings of 
               tools, as previously reported. For natural objects, drawings 
               of animals and fruit (relative to drawings of man-made 
               objects) enhanced activity in bilateral anterior temporal and 
               right posterior middle temporal cortices. Critically, these 
               effects with natural objects were not observed when the

               identification. Furthermore, activation in the same right

               unfamiliar non-objects relative to naming and matching man-
               made objects. These results indicate that, in the right 
               hemisphere, differences between processing natural relative 
               to man-made objects overlap with the effects of increasing 
               demands on object identification. In the left hemisphere, the 
               effects are more consistent with functional specialization 
               within the semantic system. ((c) 1999 APA/PsycINFO, all

		 distinguishing among individual exemplars for living thing 
		 categories; (2) no impairment in grouping living things 
		 according to their shared properties; and (3) in property 
		 verification and definition tasks, he shows good knowledge 
		 of shared but not distinctive properties of living things, 
		 (especially biological functional properties) and the 
		 reverse pattern for nonliving things. These findings cannot 
		 be accounted for by selective damage to a particular type or 
		 category of information. The authors argue that the S's 
		 deficit is predicted by a unitary model of semantic memory 
		 in which the patterns of correlation among distinctive and 
		 shared perceptual and functional properties are different 
		 for concepts in the domains of living and nonliving things. 
		 These differences in conceptual structure give rise to 
		 category- specific impairments when the semantic system is 
		 damaged, even when the damage itself is not selective."

               similarity judgments about different attributes of these

               names of living things and names of artifacts and selected 
               one of two response words as more similar to a target word 
               according to a perceptual or an associative attribute. 
               Judgments for both domains and both attribute types activated 
               a left-hemisphere semantic system, but showed some 
               differential activation. The left temporo-occipito-parietal 
               junction showed enhanced activity for judgments about object 
               location, whereas the left anteromedial temporal cortex and 
               caudate nucleus were differentially activated by color 
               judgments. Smaller differences were seen for living and 
               nonliving domains, the positive findings being largely 
               consistent with previous studies using objects; in 
               particular, words denoting artifacts produced enhanced

               naming task. Five males performed a covert naming task on

               tools. Color images of 20 items from each category were taken

               consisted of 3 presentations of each series of category 
               specific items in fixed succession. Four such runs were 
               performed by each S. While performing the task, Ss were 
               scanned using echo planar imaging. Results indicate that 
               there are multiple maps coding high-level representations of

               different conceptual categories depends on partially 
               segregated large-scale neural systems. To test this 
               hypothesis, 116 Ss with focal, unilateral lesions to various 
               sectors of the telencephalon, and 55 matched controls, were 
               studied with a procedure which required the visual 
               recognition of entities from 3 categories--unique persons, 
               non-unique animals and non-unique tools. Defective 
               recognition of persons was associated with maximal lesion 
               overlap in right temporal polar region; defective recognition 
               of animals was associated with maximal lesion overlap in 
               right mesial occipital/ventral temporal region and also in 
               left mesial occipital region; and defective recognition of 
               tools was associated with maximal lesion overlap in the 
               occipital-temporal-parietal junction of the left hemisphere. 
               The findings support the hypothesis that the normal retrieval 
               of knowledge for concrete entities from different conceptual 
               domains depends on partially segregated neural systems."
